    <h1><strong>How Undergraduate Students Apply</strong></h1></h1>
    <p><br>Students apply to VIP through an online form. Applicants must indicate a single team they would like to join.
        If you are not approved for that team for any reason, you can reapply and request another team. If you change
        your mind about which team you would like, either before or after you are approved, you can apply to join a
        different team, and the new application will replace the old one</p>
